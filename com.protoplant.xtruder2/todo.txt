

"undo" reset

add "spool surplus %" spinner and calc actual spool mass

add "spool production rate" status panel

======  Production Panel

stop all motors?

=========================

grams/sec display??

return WM to full back pos at end of each spool

put spool size (mass) in config
2nd WinderMinder extents set in config file, sync with spool size rb

move to dual-editor system???

USB disconnect alarm

=============   Chart

hack source

=== BUGS

fix StepperConfigManager#initConfig() so that new config files get init but existing ones with errors are not overwritten


improve/test/debug stepper connect/disconnect/update cycle

!! config detail -> save as... does not update view correctly (seems to save file OK - hit "revert" as workaround)


==========


experiment with "rolling update"
  don't reset steppers on exit (done)
  don't stop steppers on load  
  ++ try to pull speeds from steppers?
