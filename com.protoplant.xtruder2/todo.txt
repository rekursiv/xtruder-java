=== BUGS

fix StepperConfigManager#initConfig() so that new config files get init but existing ones with errors are not overwritten


improve/test/debug stepper connect/disconnect/update cycle

!! config detail -> save as... does not update view correctly (seems to save file OK - hit "revert" as workaround)


==========


experiment with "rolling update"
  don't reset steppers on exit (done)
  don't stop steppers on load  
  ++ try to pull speeds from steppers?
